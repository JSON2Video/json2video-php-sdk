## Hello world
JSON2Video makes video creation easy as a piece of cake:

```php
<?php
    // Create a new movie
    $movie = new Movie;

    // Set your API key
    // Get your free API key at https://json2video.com
    $movie->setAPIKey(YOUR_API_KEY);

    // Set a project ID
    $movie->project = 'myproj';

    // Set movie quality: low, medium, high
    $movie->quality = 'high';

    // Create a new scene
    $scene = new Scene;

    // Set the scene background color
    $scene->background_color = '#4392F1';

    // Add a text element printing "Hello world" in a fancy way (basic/006)
    // The element is 10 seconds long and starts 2 seconds from the scene start
    // Element's vertical position is 50 pixels from the top
    $scene->addElement([
        'type' => 'text',
        'template' => 'basic/006',
        'items' => [
            [ 'text' => 'Hello world' ]
        ],
        'y' => 50,
        'duration' => 10,
        'start' => 2
    ]);

    // Add the scene to the movie
    $movie->addScene($scene);

    // Call the API and render the movie
    $movie->render();
```
