    require_once 'path/to/the/sdk/all.php';

    use JSON2Video\Movie;
    use JSON2Video\Scene;

```

## Hello world
JSON2Video makes video creation easy as a piece of cake:

```php
<?php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

    use JSON2Video\Movie;
    use JSON2Video\Scene;

    // Create a new movie
    $movie = new Movie;

    // Set your API key
    // Get your free API key at https://json2video.com
    $movie->setAPIKey(YOUR_API_KEY);

    // Set movie quality: low, medium, high
    $movie->quality = 'high';
    $movie->draft = true;

    // Create a new scene
    $scene = new Scene;

    // Set the scene background color
    $scene->background_color = '#4392F1';

    // Add a text element printing "Hello world" in a fancy way (basic/006)
    // The element is 10 seconds long and starts 2 seconds from the scene start
    // Element's vertical position is 50 pixels from the top
    $scene->addElement([
        'type' => 'text',
        'style' => '003',
        'text' => 'Hello world',
        'duration' => 10,
        'start' => 2
    ]);

    // Add the scene to the movie
    $movie->addScene($scene);

    // Call the API and start rendering the movie
    $result = $movie->render();
    var_dump($result);

    //$result = $movie->getStatus('cLiLZ7fKeMvjb4b8');
    //var_dump($result);

    // Wait for the render to finish
    $movie->waitToFinish();
?>
```
